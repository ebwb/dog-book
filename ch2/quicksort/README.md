# quicksort
> 2.1 - Quicksort is most naturally expressed recursively. Write it iteratively and compare the two versoins. (Hoare describes how hard it was to work out quicksort iteratively, and how neatly it fell into place when he did it recursively).
> 2.3 - What are some input sequences that might cause a quicksort implementation to display worst-case behavior? try to find some that provoke your library version into running slowly. Automate the process so that you can specify and perform a large number of experiments easily.
