# lists implementation
> 2.7 - Implement some of the other list operators: copy, merge, split, insert before or after a specific item. How do the two insertion operations differ in difficulty? How much can you use the routines we've written, and how much must you create yourself? (this question assumes one's already written: remove, add, remove all, add-to-front)

## Methods implemented:
|--------|--------------|-------------|

## What all methods will be implemented:
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| add    | merge        | clear       |
| remove | split        | findFirst   |
| copy   | insertBefore | insertAfter |
