# dog-book
This repository contains exercises-as-projects from Brian Kernighan's and Rob Pike's book, [The Practice of Programming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1032758.The_Practice_of_Programming), which I, and I imagine others have decided to call 'the dog book'. 

## Exploring
Each chapter gets a directory at the root of the repository. From there, each exercise will get its own 'project', e.g. a Cargo.toml for exercises implemented in Rust.
